# üß± Task 4 ‚Äì Firewall Configuration and Traffic Filtering

## üéØ Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules on Kali Linux using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** to understand how inbound and outbound traffic can be filtered.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used
- **Kali Linux 2024.x**
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** ‚Äî front-end for iptables  
- **Netcat (nc)** ‚Äî used to verify whether specific ports are open or blocked  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps & Commands Executed
```bash
# Enable and verify UFW
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose

# Block insecure Telnet port (23)
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp

# Allow secure SSH port (22)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# View all configured rules
sudo ufw status numbered

# Test connectivity
nc -zv 127.0.0.1 23    # Should show "Connection refused"
nc -zv 127.0.0.1 22    # Should show "Connection succeeded"

# Remove the test rule
sudo ufw delete deny 23/tcp
````

## üß© Findings

| Test Case            | Expected Behaviour     | Observed Result                 | Conclusion                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Before enabling UFW  | All ports open locally | Connection on port 23 succeeded | Unfiltered traffic          |
| After `deny 23/tcp`  | Port 23 blocked        | `Connection refused`            | Telnet successfully blocked |
| After `allow 22/tcp` | SSH allowed            | `Connection succeeded`          | Selective allow verified    |
| After deleting rule  | Port 23 open again     | Connection restored             | Rule removal effective      |

---

## üìä Summary of Findings

* UFW correctly blocked and allowed traffic based on defined rules.
* Blocking port 23 prevented insecure Telnet connections.
* Allowing port 22 enabled secure SSH access.
* Demonstrated that UFW simplifies `iptables` rule management for quick configuration.

---

## üß† Learnings

* Understood inbound vs outbound traffic control.
* Learned how to use `ufw` commands for adding, deleting, and verifying rules.
* Observed immediate impact of firewall policies on network traffic.
* Reinforced principle of **least privilege** for network exposure.

## üí¨ Interview Prep ‚Äì Quick Answers

| Question                                  | Answer                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What is a firewall?**                   | A system that monitors and filters network traffic based on predefined security rules. |
| **Stateful vs Stateless firewall?**       | Stateful tracks connection states; Stateless inspects each packet individually.        |
| **Inbound vs Outbound rules?**            | Inbound = incoming traffic control; Outbound = outgoing traffic control.               |
| **How does UFW simplify management?**     | It provides an easy CLI for complex `iptables` syntax.                                 |
| **Why block port 23 (Telnet)?**           | Telnet transmits credentials in plain text; insecure.                                  |
| **Common firewall mistakes?**             | Leaving unnecessary ports open, no default deny policy, missing logging.               |
| **How does a firewall improve security?** | Limits attack surface and enforces access control.                                     |
| **What is NAT in firewalls?**             | Network Address Translation ‚Äì rewrites IPs to hide internal network structure.         |
